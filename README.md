# SIEM Lab - pfSense + Ubuntu + Kali + Splunk + Splunk UF

Short description: A reproducible lab demonstrating ingest, parsing, detection, and dashboards for pfSense firewall logs and Ubuntu host telemetry using Splunk.

## Quickstart
- See `docs/` for architecture, test plan, and playbooks.
- Example configs are in `configs/`.
- Dashboards and saved searches are in `splunk/`.
- Log files, configuration snapshots, and screenshots collected during each test case in `evidence/`.

## Ultimate Goal
Document the architecture for the SIEM lab used to ingest pfSense and Ubuntu (host) telemetry, run Kali simulation vulnerability/pen tests, and evaluate detections in Splunk through visualized and understandable metrics.
